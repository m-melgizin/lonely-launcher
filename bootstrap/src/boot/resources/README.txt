TL;DR: If you're reading this file please open Lonely Launcher with Java, not with archiver!

Hello! Thanks for installing Lonely Launcher!
If an archive with this file was opened instead of our launcher:
1. Click LonelyLauncher.jar with right mouse button
2. Select "properties"
3. Select "change..." in the "Application" row
4. Select Java in opened window
4.1. No Java? Install Java from java.com/download
4.2. You've installed Java, but there is no Java in applications list?
     Use JarFix program from https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html
5. Click "Ok" and close "properties" window. All done!

Using Linux? Search for Java 8 package (usually named like jre8-openjdk or openjdk-8-jre)
in your distro repos and install it using package manager (apt, apt-get, pacman, pamac, yum, dnf, portage...)

Using macOS? Install Java from java.com/download
